In this workshop I mainly learned about the constructors and destructors. I struggled a lot in this workshop in the DIY part as I was not able to do it for most of the time and I was stuck for so long because of dynamic memory errors but then by researching for the topic I resolved the error. 

I also learned about the go to statement while making this code as it was required in the read function. For most of the time I was using the ignore method in the read function to get the 40 characters of the string but I was not able to get it. Therefore, then I discover an another method of using goto statement to pass control of my if- else statement but then finally I used strCpy in the print function to get only the 40 characters of the string and display the output as required.
