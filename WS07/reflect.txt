In this workshop, I learned a lot about the inheritance and how to use it constructors and destructors. This workshop took me 2 hours to complete and it was a little bit confusing at first as inheritance was new concept for me but overall I learned a lot in this workshop. Mainly, i got to learn about how to use the one class inside another class.

Regarding the milestone 2, it was little bit hard for me as it really very long and took me 2 days to complete it in which I was stuck for 1 day in my read() function in the istream operator as I was not able to pass the last test cases but then I figure it out as I have to intialize its values to data members by creating the getter and setter methods to make it work correctly.
