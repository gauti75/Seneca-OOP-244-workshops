In this workshop, I mainly learned about the Modular programming and how to seperate different modules into different header files and how to implement them . I also learned about the different methods to add the headers files by using #ifndef or #pragmaonce. These methods were very helpful and it helps me to understand why we only need to prevent getting linking error. Also, this workshop clears my concept regarding file handling in C++ as it was the most essential part of this workshop to read, load and then display the filtered data
according to user input.

The lab part of this workshop was easy for me and it also builds the kind of foundation for me to the part 2 of the workshop. I struggled with part 2 a lot and I did that for 3 days. But finally I was able to do it with the help of professor and some of the code from the lab part of the workshop. The main issue for which i struggled a lot was to load the data from the file and I was stuck with for more than 1 day but then I changed my approach and instead of using the fcanf, I tried to use the ifstream and finally I was able to load the data correctly.
