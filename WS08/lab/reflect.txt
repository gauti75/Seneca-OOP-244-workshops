In this workshop, I learned about the virtual and pure virtual functions. I also learned about the interface and abstract class and I also got to know that how to use these functions effectively to maximize the reusing of our code. I was having memory error in the workshop firstly because of a stupid mistake which I was making but overall this workshop was easy to do and took me 3 hours overall to complete it. I also got to know about the concept of inheritance more appropriately using different classes and how the derieved classes are linked to the base classes including destructors and constructors.
