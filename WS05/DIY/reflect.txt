In this workshop I learned about the operator overloading concept which is very important in C++. This concept was relatively new for me and it took me some time to fully implement the overloading of operators. I learned that in C++, we can overload any operator with exception to some and these operators can be very helpful in making our program simplified and it helps to make them work efficiently. I also learned about overloading of insertion operator << along with the use of the ostream reference to display the program. I struggled in doing overlading of post and prefix unary operators first in the lab part of this workshop but at the end of DIY workshop I was able to do that efficiently.
I learned that we can overload any operator as much as it makes mathematical sense and it has many application such as to add two classes or more.
